File: app/components/ServiceWorkerRegistration.tsx

Purpose:
This component registers the service worker for PWA functionality.

Key Features:
1. Checks if service workers are supported by the browser.
2. Registers the service worker file (sw.js) when the window loads.

Notes:
- This component should be included in the main app component or layout.
- It doesn't render anything visible, it only performs the registration.
